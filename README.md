# Little Window
> Little window is a clever little cat chatbot that directs women to the information they are looking for as quickly as possible. Think of it like google search on turbo for all of Chaynâ€™s resources and those provided by our friends too. We want to drastically reduce the time women take to search for information which in many cases can save lives.

**Currently in active development**

### Running locally
Install dependancies
`npm install`

Run the server and the client separately, using only the following commands to ensure correct binaries are used.
Server: `npm run start` or `npm run start:dev`
Client: `cd client && npm run start`

### Testing
Server: `npm run test`
Client:  `cd client && npm run test`

### Formatting and Linting

## Conversation Structure
The Little Window conversation is structured into three distinct sections.
1) Setup
All of the questions required to setup the conversation including GDPR & Language settings. These must be set before we can deliver any more content to the user.
2) Support
The bulk of the conversation. This is where Little Window determines what the user wants and sends them relevant resources. Little Window determines what the user wants via either NLP or directly offering a selection of it's knowledge.
3) Feedback
At the end of the conversation we collect feedback to improve Little Window with four questions.
